" SQL_injection_detection_using-DL" 
SQL injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in an application's software to gain unauthorized access to the database. Deep learning can be used to detect and prevent SQL injection by identifying patterns and anomalies that indicate an attack. Hereâ€™s how deep learning can help in detecting SQL injection:
1.Data processing
2.Tokenization
3.Word Embedding
5.Feature Extraction
4.2D CNN model with 3 convolutional,3 maxpooling layer, 1 flatten and 3 fully connected layer
